Analyze each feature column to determine if its computation might use data from after the 
prediction time point.

Based on the prediction task description and the preprocessing code, infer when the 
prediction happens, then determine if each feature could contain future information.

You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.`;

Feature columns to analyze:
${featureList}

Preprocessing code context:
${request.preprocessing_code}

For each feature, determine:
1. Could this feature's value include information from after the inferred prediction time point?
2. Does the feature name suggest aggregations (mean, sum, count, total, avg) that might span beyond the prediction boundary?
3. Is the feature only knowable after the outcome has occurred?
