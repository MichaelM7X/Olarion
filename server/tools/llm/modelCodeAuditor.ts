Focus on:
- Feature selection or feature importance computed on the full dataset before splitting
- Hyperparameter tuning that uses test data
- Validation design issues (e.g. not using grouped or time-aware CV)
- Target leakage through feature engineering in the training pipeline

${request.model_training_code}
\`\`\`

${request.preprocessing_code ? `Preprocessing code (for context):\n\n\`\`\`python\n${request.preprocessing_code}\n\`\`\`` : ""}

Analyze this training code for:
1. Is feature selection (SelectKBest, RFE, feature_importances_) done on the full dataset before splitting?
2. Is hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV) using a proper validation strategy?
3. Does the validation split respect entity boundaries and time ordering?
4. Are there any other leakage or methodological issues?

Respond in this exact JSON format:
